abstract: Efficient management of imbalanced time series data is of paramount importance
  when data located in the tails, particularly extreme values, have a substantial
  influence on predic- tive outcomes. This paper introduces FSDA (Feature Selection
  and Data Augmentation), a combined approach of feature selection and data augmentation,
  to address this issue. FSDA aims to identify the most predictive features for tail
  data, which may exhibit differ- ent sensitivities compared to the rest of the dataset.
  Data augmentation, a conventional technique for handling imbalanced data, is employed
  to enhance the accuracy of machine learning regression methods. Augmented information
  is strategically incorporated using time-warping and drift methods to maintain the
  temporal integrity of the data. Empirical evidence based on a use case in financial
  data reveals that FSDA consistently outperforms feature selection (FS) and data
  augmentation (DA) methods across all percentiles ranging from 85 to 99, demonstrating
  its efficacy in managing imbalanced time series data and improving predictive accuracy.
