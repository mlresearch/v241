abstract: Imbalanced data poses a significant challenge in classification as model
  performance is af- fected by insufficient learning from minority classes. Balancing
  methods are often used to address this problem. However, such techniques can lead
  to problems such as overfitting or loss of information. This study addresses a more
  challenging aspect of balancing methods - their impact on model behavior. To capture
  these changes, Explainable Artificial Intel- ligence tools are used to compare models
  trained on datasets before and after balancing. In addition to the Variable Importance
  method, this study uses Partial Dependence and Accumulated Local Effects profiles.
  Real and simulated datasets are tested, and an open- source Python package edgaro
  is developed to facilitate this analysis. The results obtained show significant
  changes in model behavior due to balancing methods, which can lead to biased models
  toward a balanced distribution. These findings confirm that balancing analysis should
  go beyond model performance comparisons to achieve higher reliability of machine
  learning models. Therefore, we propose a new method performance gain plot for informed
  data balancing strategy to make an optimal selection of balancing method by analyzing
  the measure of change in model behavior versus performance gain.
