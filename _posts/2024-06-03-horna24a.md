abstract: 'Improving the classification of multi-class imbalanced data is more difficult
  than its two- class counterpart. In this paper, we use deep neural networks to train
  new representations of tabular multi-class data. Unlike the typically developed
  re-sampling pre-processing meth- ods, our proposal modifies the distribution of
  features, i.e. the positions of examples in the learned embedded representation,
  and it does not modify the class sizes. To learn such embedded representations we
  introduced various definitions of triplet loss functions: the simplest one uses
  weights related to the degree of class imbalance, while the next pro- posals are
  intended for more complex distributions of examples and aim to generate a safe neighborhood
  of minority examples. Similarly to the resampling approaches, after applying such
  preprocessing, different classifiers can be trained on new representations. Experiments
  with popular multi-class imbalanced benchmark data sets and three classifiers showed
  the advantage of the proposed approach over popular pre-processing methods as well
  as basic versions of neural networks with classical loss function formulations.'
