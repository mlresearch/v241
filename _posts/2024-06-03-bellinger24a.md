abstract: Learning classifiers from imbalanced data is known to be a challenging and
  important prob- lem in machine learning. As a results, the topic has been studied
  from a wide variety of angles. This includes the choice of evaluation measures and
  understanding the implica- tions of minority class subconcepts on model learning.
  In this work, however, we argue that the community may not be using precise enough
  evaluation measures when assessing the performance of imbalanced learning pipelines
  on data that includes an imbalance in the minority class subconcepts. We show that
  the performance estimates from standard measures used in imbalance learning are
  biased towards the largest minority subconcepts, and that standard imbalance correction
  techniques can exacerbate the bias. Finally, we demonstrate that the bias can, in
  part, be corrected by applying instance weighting in the evaluation measures.
